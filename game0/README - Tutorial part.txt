Platform and How to Compile:

I developed on Windows using the Visual Studio 2019. The game requires SFML to be
installed on the system and the Dragonfly engine to be in the in a
directory called dragonfly/ next to the game/ directory. Run the sauser-shoot.sln with 
Visual Studio 2019. 


Source code I wrote is contained in the *.cpp and *.h files in the
game0.

game0/sounds/ - contains the sound files used in Saucer Shoot
game0/sprites/ - contains the sprite files used in Saucer Shoot
game0/vs2019/ 

See README - Extension part.txt for my modications to the Saucer Shoot game
